## Developing 

clone the repo then run npm install.

Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running then run `npm run devstart` to start a development server.

Run `grunt` in another window in order to compile the javascript files.

Only edit the javascrpt files in the dev folder as the files in dist are built by the grunt script 

Not that you will not see any changes you make to the javascript files unless grunt is running
